By making a booking, you acknowledge that you have accurately chosen the appropriate service and time duration for your vehicle's condition. In the event that our team requires more time than initially allotted for your chosen service, an additional fee will be applied.

Regarding payment, we operate on a cash-on-delivery (COD) basis, similar to other car wash services. We also offer electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS) facilities if needed.

To successfully carry out the detailing service for your vehicle, we require access to water and a power supply. Additionally, you need to provide a secure off-road parking space that complies with legal regulations, and this parking space should be arranged and provided by you, the vehicle owner.

When it comes to your personal information, Hao's Garage collects such information through customer-provided means, whether verbally or through online booking. Rest assured that no personal customer information will be shared with any external party outside of the Hao's Garage business. The sole purpose of retaining customer details is to ensure the best possible customer service.

A protocol is in place for employees who are authorized and obligated to utilize body-worn cameras during vehicle detailing procedures. The focus of this procedure is to maintain the privacy of individuals. Personal information, including license plates, captured by camera footage will be treated confidentially by all personnel who have access to it. This handling aligns with government privacy policies and legal requirements.
